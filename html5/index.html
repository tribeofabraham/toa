                <h2>NCTM Pandemic</h2>
                <p>This is a remake of an app I had created many years ago which for obvious reasons suddely became
                    relavent again. In the app I simulated Fauci's simple three variable equation to show not only the
                    random
                    variability of the outcomes but also how moving a data point like "contacts" could make a big
                    difference.
                </p>
                <p>There is an accompanying lesson plan but you can just hit calculate then play. The SVG files are
                    rendered
                    dynamically within the DOM.</p>
                <p>If you rollover just below and to the left of the anniversary logo until your cursors disappears and
                    then
                    click you will unlock an easter egg which allows larger populations</p>

                <p>The bar chart representing the data is rendered as SVG from within the DOM. Every time "Calculate" is
                    clicked a new random set which is used to create the next plot.</p>

                <p>Client had an interactive that accompanied their classroom instructions and materials</p>
                <p>The bar for WCAG and ADA is much higher now in the academic community and they asked me to help them
                    reimagine this tool as a compliant HTML5 asset.</p>
                <p>Building an asset like this dynamically from JSON data allows me to address WCAG and accessibility
                    issues
                    BEFORE the asset is dropped in the DOM. Loading the tabs data from a JSON source allows the tile
                    sets and
                    instructional videos to be easily customized. There is a feature that allows an alternate tab set to
                    be
                    loaded via URL parameters.</p>

                <p>Customer had a large collection of multilingual instructional material that they wanted to package
                    and
                    monetize to satisfy the growing demand for multilingual support in the public schools.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately resources were quite limited at the time so we needed to get creative. We had a team of
                    two to
                    put the assets together and I had them organize the data using Excel spreadsheets which I used
                    Python to
                    injest into a JSON format.</p>

                <p>An app in progress for Ragamuffin Hall to introduce fans to a method of communicating music through
                    numbers
                    instead of notes.</p>
                <p>Choosing a key and a progression will reveal the chord patterns. Transpose will raise or lower the
                    pitch of
                    the progression relatively while swapping the visible layers of the single SVG chord chart.</p>
                    <p>I am fascinated with the music and science of music and also program IoT hardware devices for sequencing and sampling.</p>
